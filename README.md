# How to use:

##### Use index.html to run the app

# If you want to make changes and look at them use:

##### 1. npm install

##### 2. npm run build

*In the conditions of the test app, it was not possible to use the DevServer, so webpack.config is not have setting for it. The application works only when starting index.html*
