# How to use:

> **1. git clone https://github.com/Makflay/worldOnline.git**

> **2. Use index.html to run the app**

# If you want to make changes and look at them use:

> **1. cd worldOnline**

> **2. npm install**

> **3. npm run build**

> **4. refresh index.html**

> <p>*In the conditions of the test app, it was not possible to use the DevServer, so webpack.config is not have setting for it. The application works only when starting index.html*</p>
